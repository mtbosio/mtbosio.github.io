            Hi, my name is <strong>Matthew Bosio</strong> and welcome to my
            personal portfolio! I am a third year
            <strong>Computer Science</strong> student at Cal Poly, San Luis
            Obispo. I have career interests in building
            <strong>full-stack web applications</strong> and
            <strong>video game development</strong>. Outside of technology I
            enjoy playing basketball, running, hiking, and hanging out with
            friends.
