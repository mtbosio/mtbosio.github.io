        Hi, my name is <strong>Matthew Bosio</strong> and welcome to my personal
        portfolio! I am a third year <strong>Computer Science</strong> student
        at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. I have career interests in building
        <strong>full-stack web applications</strong> and
        <strong>video game development</strong>. Outside of technology I enjoy
        playing basketball, running, hiking, and hanging out with friends.
